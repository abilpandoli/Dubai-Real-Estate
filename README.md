# Dubai-Real-Estate
Using data from 73,742 residential listings, this project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on factors like rent prices, property types, and geographic locations. It explores relationships between property features (beds, baths, area) and rental costs to provide insights into the UAE's real estate "goldmine."
